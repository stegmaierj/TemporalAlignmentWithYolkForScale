# Experiments for evaluation the SimpleAlign approach:

1. Synthetic Time Aligns:
1.1 Random gaussian shifts
1.2 stable shift with some gaussian noise
1.3 different resolution in time
1.4 embryo 1 is slower in first half, and faster in second half (cos)

2. Reference Samples
4 zebrafish Embryos

3. Approach:
Use relative size with yolk size for scale

4. stochastical proof:
Calculate mean and standrd derivation of error margin
